# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview 

In this supervised machine learning project, I was tasked with helping a credit risk company. We all know that good loans outnumber risky ones, therefore credit risk has a naturally unbalanced classification issue. I was able to use different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. I then evaluated the performance of these models to determine if they can be used to predict credit risk and help this company evaluate it potential loan recipients.
